ROBOTIC VEHICLE PROJECT - SETUP AND OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- Raspberry Pi or similar SBC
- Required hardware components (listed in README.md)

Hardware Setup:
1. Connect sensors to appropriate GPIO pins
2. Verify power requirements for each component
3. Ensure proper grounding and electrical isolation

Software Installation:
1. Clone the project repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure hardware:
   - Edit config/config.json with your specific hardware mappings
   - Calibrate sensors using config/sensor_calibration.json

Running the Vehicle:
1. Perform pre-flight checks:
   - Verify sensor connections
   - Check battery levels
   - Ensure clear operating area

2. Start the main application:
   python src/main.py

3. Use Bluetooth controller for manual operation
   - Refer to bluetooth_controller.py for protocol details

Troubleshooting:
- Check system_logs/ for error details
- Verify GPIO connections
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed

Safety Warnings:
- Always operate in a controlled environment
- Maintain visual contact with the vehicle
- Keep hands and objects clear during operation
